# :lock: Authentication template Express JS using Passport.js and Google OAuth2

This is a simple JS template project using Express JS and Passport.js.
As my transition to JavaScript is advancing so are the types of projects.Here i wanted to practice authentication
with local database and also with Oauth2.
My code is written modular now,as I advanced my Express.js knowledge.
